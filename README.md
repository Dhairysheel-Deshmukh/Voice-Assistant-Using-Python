# Voice-Assistant-Using-Python

I had made voice assistant using python. In this we used different libraries in python language. And also we used loops, conditional statements, break statement etc.
By using this voice assistant, we can give some commands to our PC or laptop and then our device will display result according to our instructions. In our project, when we run program the user can give commands like open youtube, open facebook, open google etc. through the microphone in laptop and computer will open that site for the user. One of the best feature of our program is that we can play any video on youtube by just giving voice command to our laptop.
This voice assistant is built on artificial intelligence , ML and voice recognition technology. We can make it more better by 
using artificial intelligence and machine learning.
The future of voice recognition is looking bright. Given its current usage both in the home and on the move, it seems as through this technology will only get bigger over the next few years.
